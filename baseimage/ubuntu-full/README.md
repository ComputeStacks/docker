# Ubuntu Full Base Image

This is a base image used by some of our images. It's based on the [Phusion Base Image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker), just updated more frequently and with a few common packages we need.

This includes cron, syslog, and a full init system for our larger container images.
